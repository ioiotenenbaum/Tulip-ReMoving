	<p>If you’re worried about moving day, you are not alone.</p>
	<p>In a recent survey, moving a home was ranked life’s third most stressful experience,
	above childbirths and job interviews. And why wouldn’t it be?
	You barely completed the long, tedious process of finding a new home,
	and now you find yourself having to move practically all your possessions to it in a matter of days.
	And we haven’t even brought up updating your address, signing up for utilities and internet access, change subscriptions, and the list goes on.
	With all the stresses involved, it is understandable that house movers have little attention left to dedicate to sustainability.
	In fact, almost four in ten UK movers say recycling is the ‘last thing’ on their minds during a house move.
	As a result, over a quarter of UK movers reportedly throw away over 30 recyclable or reusable items.
	</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>The impact of this adds up: Throughout the UK, approximately 90 million cardboard boxes are used each year during moves — the equivalent of over one million trees, or one eighth of all the trees in London. An additional £150m of household waste is generated in the UK every year during house moves alone. This waste makes up a significant portion of over a million Tonnes of municipal and residential wood waste generated every year in the UK.
	We’re on a mission to make a positive change in the way people move. Our vision is to offer you a zero-stress, zero-waste moving experience that you and our planet both deserve. To do so, we’re taking responsibility for every step:
	</p>
	<ol class=listy>
		<li>Packing your belongings with care using reusable totes made from recycled plastic, reusable padding and multi-use protection equipment</li>
		<li>Transporting your belongings using zero-emission electric vans</li>
		<li>Delivering your unwanted furniture to find a new life through resell or donation</li>
		<li>Unpacking your belongings in your new home, taking all our packing equipment with us to our next move</li>
	</ol>
	<p>By leaving it to us to move your home in the most environmentally-friendly way, you are left only to enjoy a guilt-free, stress-free move.</p> -->

If you feel anxious about moving day, you’re not alone.
<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/moving-house-stress-tips-advice-buyers-b2749037.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a recent survey</a>, moving a home was ranked life’s third most stressful experience, above childbirths and job interviews. 
</p>

<p>
And it’s easy to see why. After the long and exhausting process of finding a new home, you’re suddenly faced with the task of packing and moving nearly all your possessions in a matter of days. On top of this comes the administrative load: updating your address, arranging utilities, setting up internet access, managing subscriptions, and more. In the midst of all this, it’s understandable that sustainability is not the first thing on movers’ minds. In fact, <a href="https://cardboard.org.uk/news/young-people-commit-sins-on-moving-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">surveys suggest</a> that almost 4 in 10 UK movers admit recycling is “the last thing” they think about during a move. As a result, over a quarter of movers reportedly throw away more than 30 recyclable or reusable items.
</p>

<p>
The environmental impact of this is enormous. We estimate that, across the UK, 90 million cardboard boxes are used every year for house moves—equivalent to more than <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/how-many-trees-does-it-take-to-make-1-ton-of-paper.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one million trees</a>, or around one-eighth of <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-and-strategies/environment-and-climate-change/parks-green-spaces-and-biodiversity/trees-and-woodlands/london-tree-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">London’s entire tree population</a>. Recent <a href="https://www.suez.co.uk/en-gb/news/press-releases/230918-home-movers-research-reveals-brits-could-be-throwing-away-up-to-150m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">industry reports</a> also estimate that £150 million worth of household waste is generated during moves each year, contributing to the more than <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uk-waste-data/uk-statistics-on-waste" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one million tonnes</a> of municipal and residential wood waste produced annually in the UK.

<p>
At Tulip ReMoving, our vision is to change this. We believe you deserve a zero-stress, zero-waste moving experience—one that benefits you, your belongings, and the planet. That’s why we take responsibility at every step:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Packing sustainably:</strong> Using reusable crates made from recycled plastic, multi-use padding, and protective equipment that we take back and use again.</li>
  <li><strong>Transporting responsibly:</strong> Operating with zero-emission electric vans, reducing the carbon footprint of every move by up to 80% compared with diesel alternatives.</li>
  <li><strong>Giving furniture a second life:</strong> Delivering unwanted furniture to resale or donation partners, ensuring it avoids landfill and helps others in need.</li>
  <li><strong>Unpacking and clearing:</strong> Once your belongings are safely delivered, we remove all packing materials to be reused for the next move—leaving your new home clutter-free from day one.</li>
</ul>

<p>
By leaving it to Tulip ReMoving to move your home, you’re helping to protect your wellbeing and our planet. We make sure the process is as sustainable, simple, and stress-free as possible, so you can focus on settling into your new home without the guilt or the hassle.
