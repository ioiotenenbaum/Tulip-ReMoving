  <h1>Q&A</h1>
    <h3>Do you offer international (outside the UK) moving services?</h3>
  <p>We are working hard to expand the range of moves we can support. At present, however, our services are limited to local moves within London.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>Are there any additional fees I will be asked to pay after I book?</h3>
  <p>In most cases, no. The price you see at the time of booking is the final cost of your move. Additional charges may only apply in the following circumstances:</p>
  <ul class="listy">
    <li>If the information provided at booking does not match the actual circumstances on moving day.</li>
    <li>If you make last-minute requests, such as delivering items to a second address or arranging storage.</li>
    <li>If there are significant delays to accessing your new property (for example, due to key collection issues).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Please note: if we can access your new property by 1:00 pm on the day of the move, no delay charge will apply.</em></p>
  <hr>

  <h3>Do you offer self-packing moves or packing material rental?</h3>
  <p>Tulip ReMoving was founded with a commitment to both supporting movers and reducing environmental impact. At this stage, we do not provide self-packing services or packaging rental. We do, however, plan to offer sustainable packaging solutions in the future.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>Are your moves insured?</h3>
  <p>Yes. All of our moves are fully insured, including cover for your belongings in transit. You can review the full insurance terms <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. In addition, many home insurance policies also provide cover during a move, so it may be worth checking with your insurer.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>How do you decide how many movers and vehicles are needed for a job?</h3>
  <p>The details you provide at booking allow us to calculate the appropriate number of movers and vehicles. Around one week before your moving date, our team will contact you to confirm the details and ensure that everything is in order, with no surprises on the day.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>How far in advance should I book my move?</h3>
  <p>We recommend booking as early as possible, particularly during peak moving periods such as summer and month-end. While we can often accommodate last-minute moves, early booking guarantees availability and ensures everything runs smoothly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>Can I reschedule or cancel my booking?</h3>
  <p>Yes. We understand that plans can change. Moves can be rescheduled or cancelled, though certain conditions and notice periods may apply. Please see our cancellation and rescheduling policy <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>Do I need to be present on moving day?</h3>
  <p>Ideally, yes — we ask that either you or a trusted representative is available at both the collection and delivery addresses. This ensures we can access the property and that all belongings are moved according to your instructions.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>What steps do you take to ensure your moves are sustainable?</h3>
  <p>Sustainability is at the heart of Tulip ReMoving. We carefully plan routes to minimise fuel use, invest in efficient vehicles, and are developing reusable packaging solutions. By choosing us, you’re helping reduce the environmental impact of moving.</p>
