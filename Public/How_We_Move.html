    <h1>Our vision</h1>
    <p>If you’re worried about moving day, you are not alone.</p>
	<p>In a recent survey, moving a home was ranked life’s third most stressful experience,
	above childbirths and job interviews. And why wouldn’t it be?
	You barely completed the long, tedious process of finding a new home,
	and now you find yourself having to move practically all your possessions to it in a matter of days.
	And we haven’t even brought up updating your address, signing up for utilities and internet access, change subscriptions, and the list goes on.
	With all the stresses involved, it is understandable that house movers have little attention left to dedicate to sustainability.
	In fact, almost four in ten UK movers say recycling is the ‘last thing’ on their minds during a house move.
	As a result, over a quarter of UK movers reportedly throw away over 30 recyclable or reusable items.
	</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>The impact of this adds up: Throughout the UK, approximately 90 million cardboard boxes are used each year during moves — the equivalent of over one million trees, or one eighth of all the trees in London. An additional £150m of household waste is generated in the UK every year during house moves alone. This waste makes up a significant portion of over a million Tonnes of municipal and residential wood waste generated every year in the UK.
	We’re on a mission to make a positive change in the way people move. Our vision is to offer you a zero-stress, zero-waste moving experience that you and our planet both deserve. To do so, we’re taking responsibility for every step:
	</p>
	<ol class=listy>
		<li>Packing your belongings with care using reusable totes made from recycled plastic, reusable padding and multi-use protection equipment</li>
		<li>Transporting your belongings using zero-emission electric vans</li>
		<li>Delivering your unwanted furniture to find a new life through resell or donation</li>
		<li>Unpacking your belongings in your new home, taking all our packing equipment with us to our next move</li>
	</ol>
	<p>By leaving it to us to move your home in the most environmentally-friendly way, you are left only to enjoy a guilt-free, stress-free move.</p>
